# asteroids

Arcade classic Asteroids, coded in Python with Pygame!

## How to run the code

I did try to make a Dockerfile for this project. But I ran into the issue of trying to run a GUI in a container.

1. Create the venv
  ```
  python3 -m .venv
  ```

2. Activate the venv
  ```
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. Install the requirements.txt
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run the main program
  ```
  python3 main.py
  ```

Enjoy!
