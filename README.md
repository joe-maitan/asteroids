Arcade classic Asteroids, coded in Python with Pygame!

## How to run the code

I used ```uv``` as the package manager for this project. If you do not have it installed, you can check out how to install it on your system [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

After installing uv and downloading/cloning the repo. You can run the code by typing:
